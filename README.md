# RetroArch-LmStudio-Adapter

**RetroArch-LLM-Adapter** is an experimental RetroArch AI services that connects to local LM-Studio to generate translation. LM Studio's Local LLM Service might need to be enabled (haven't tried when it's disabled). 

Only Google's `gemma-3-4b-it-qat` model is tested so far with satisfied result. 

Tested on Windows and MacOS.
